Issue : https://github.com/awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action/issues/44

Without apt-get install:

https://github.com/crdoconnor/apt-cache-bug/actions/runs/2796959595

Failure is expected here


On first run with the apt package cacher: 

https://github.com/crdoconnor/apt-cache-bug/actions/runs/2796966025

Should work. apt-get install is run for read.
